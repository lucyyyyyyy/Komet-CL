# Komet-CL (Crash Landing)

Next-gen rewrite of Kurisu/Robocop/Komet bot used by AtlasNX, ReSwitched and Nintendo Homebrew with discord.py rewrite, designed to be relatively clean, consistent and un-bloated.

Code is based on https://gitlab.com/ao/dpybotbase and https://github.com/916253/Kurisu-Reswitched.


---

## How to run

- Copy `config.py.template` to `config.py`, configure all necessary parts to your server.
- Install python3.6+.
- Install python dependencies (`pip3 install -Ur requirements.txt`, you might need to put `sudo -H` before that)
- If you're moving from Kurisu or Robocop: Follow `Tips for people moving from Kurisu/Robocop` below.
- Run `Robocop.py` (`python3 Robocop.py`)

To keep the bot running, you might want to use pm2 or a systemd service.

## Tips for people moving from Kurisu/Robocop

If you're moving from Kurisu/Robocop, and want to preserve your data, you'll want to do the following steps:

- Copy your `data` folder over.
- Rename your `data/warnsv2.json` file to `data/userlog.json`.
- Edit `data/restrictions.json` and replace role names (`"Muted"` etc) with role IDs (`526500080879140874` etc). Make sure to have it as int, not as str (don't wrap role id with `"` or `'`).

- [ ] New moderation feature: timelock (channel lockdown with time, relies on robocronp)

<details>
